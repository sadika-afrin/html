    <p style="color: blue; background-color: black;">Object Oriented Programming is supported in Python via classes and objects. A class is a user-defined data type that acts like a blueprint. It consists of data members and functions to manipulate the data. Classes are useful for creating multiple objects of the same data type. When these objects are created by the user, this is termed instantiating a class. The object created is also known as an instance of the class.

    <p class="p2">There are multiple ways to provide multiple constructors in Python. Suppose you want to have a function in Python, that behaves differently depending on if you send in a list or a string or any other type as a function argument. In statically typed languages like C++ and Java, we explicitly specify the type of the data in the function signature. This enables us to overload that function in statically typed languages and is termed function overloading.
    </p>

    <p class="p3">Python doesn't support function overloading. The classes in Python maintain a dictionary dict, which holds the class namespace. This class namespace is simply a dictionary mapping the attributes and methods of the class to function implementation in memory. Now dictionaries cannot have repeated keys so Python does not have function overloading. Example Consider the example below. A class Person is defined with two data members and two functions.
